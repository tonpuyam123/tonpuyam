      <h2>Current Research</h2>
      <p>
        The global cultivation of Cavendish bananas is severely threatened by Fusarium wilt caused by the soil-borne
        fungus <em>Fusarium oxysporum</em> f. sp. <em>cubense</em> tropical race 4 (TR4). Although breeding TR4-resistant
        cultivars is constrained by triploidy and sterility, the Taiwan Banana Research Institute (TBRI) has developed
        somaclonal variants that exhibit stable resistance to TR4. However, the precise mutations and molecular mechanisms
        underlying this resistance remain unclear.
      </p>
      <p>
        My research aims to elucidate the genetic basis of TR4 resistance in these TBRI somaclonal variants by 
        identifying causal somatic mutations and key regulatory genes. We discovered that highly resistant variants share 
        common chromosomal deletions that reduce gene copy number and expression. Within these deleted regions, we 
        identified candidate susceptibility genes belonging to the <em>Autoinhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase</em> 
        (<em>ACA</em>) family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system, we demonstrated that silencing these 
        <em>ACA</em> genes in susceptible bananas elevates salicylic acid (SA) marker gene expression and attenuates 
        TR4 disease symptoms. These findings suggest that reduced <em>ACA</em> expression enhances SA-mediated immunity 
        and contributes to durable resistance to Fusarium wilt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ongoing work includes the development of CRISPR-edited lines targeting these <em>ACA</em> genes for stable 
        modification and the generation of transgenic <em>Arabidopsis</em> lines to investigate their subcellular 
        localization. Future directions will test whether silencing or knockout of these genes in other susceptible 
        banana cultivars can similarly confer resistance to TR4.
